# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is aimed at predicting heart disease based on various health parameters. We use the **Heart Disease dataset** from Cleveland to train a **Random Forest Classifier** and evaluate its performance.

## Description

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a heart disease diagnosis in a patient based on several health features. The model is trained using a **Random Forest Classifier** and evaluated on test data. We also visualize correlations among different health features using a heatmap.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
